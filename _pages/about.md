<div class="notice notice--info" markdown="1" style="border-left: 4px solid #22b3eb;">
**Research Focus**
- *ML Level:* Deriving sparsity in weights and activation to preserve model accuracy at high sparsity
- *System Level:* GPU kernel support for sparse AI on existing compute platforms
- *Architecture Level:* Novel architectural changes to better support sparsity and improve efficiency
- *Circuit Level:* End-to-end chip implementation and post-silicon measurement for performance validation
- Efforts in HW Efficient LLM, Video AI, dynamically reconfigurable architecture, and RAG
